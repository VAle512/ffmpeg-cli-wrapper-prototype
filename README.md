# FFMPEG-CLI-WRAPPER-PROTOTYPE

This is a small prototype to familiarize with [ffmpeg-cli-wrapper](https://github.com/bramp/ffmpeg-cli-wrapper).

**Please Note** that FFMPEG needs to be installed on your machine. See [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Before starting the application check if the paths in the [config.properties](src/main/resources/config.properties) file are correct.
